MJPG STREAMER IS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT WAS USED IN GETTING A VIDEO FEED FROM THE PI CAMERA

Current Issues:
-Getting an automated script to start the video server on startup
-Camera control needs fine tuning
-Camera control and camera feed are on two separate programs
 -Needs Browser open on the website and a separate Python program running the pan/tilt motors

To-Do-List:
-Get a video feed instead of a timelapse picture function as video
-Implement recording functionality into website
-Fine tune camera control
-Maybe implement camera control into website
